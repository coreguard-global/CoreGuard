# CoreGuard Evidence Matrix — three axes, never one word

> **Why this file changed (2026-11-10).** It used to collapse executed Stellar
> work into one combined verdict label, while `packages/stellar/README.md` said `DRY_RUN / NOT_BUILT`
> and `status()` returned `integrationStatus: NOT_BUILT`. Both were true about
> different questions, and the single label let a reader average them into "the
> integration works". The three axes below cannot be averaged, and
> `test/ci/surface-status.test.js` fails the build if a combined label returns.
> Full record: [`STELLAR-STATUS-UNIFICATION.md`](STELLAR-STATUS-UNIFICATION.md).
> Machine-readable registry: [`surface-status.json`](surface-status.json).

## The three axes

| Axis | The question it answers | Allowed values |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | Does the surface exist in the committed tree? | `BUILT` · `BUILT_UNVERIFIED` · `PLAN_ONLY` · `NOT_BUILT` |
| **Execution** | Has anything been run, with an artifact proving it? | `EXECUTED` · `REAL_BOOK_EXECUTED` · `POLICY_GATE_EXECUTED` · `TEST_EXECUTED` · `NONE` |
| **Integration** | Can an outside project adopt it today? | `ADOPTED` · `PILOT` · `NOT_BUILT` |

**Rules the machine enforces.** `ADOPTED` and `PILOT` require a named external
party plus committed evidence. `EXECUTED` never implies `ADOPTED`. `NONE` on the
execution axis is a fact, not a failure. Today every surface is
`integration=NOT_BUILT`: **no external project runs CoreGuard, and no customer
has adopted it.**

## Stellar

| Surface | Code | Execution | Integration | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `stellar-adapter` — read / build / submit gate | BUILT | NONE (no live call by design) | NOT_BUILT — no external consumer | `packages/stellar/index.mjs`; `status()` returns `DRY_RUN` / `NOT_BUILT` |
| `stellar-soroban-anchor` — commitment anchor contract | BUILT (soroban-sdk 23) | EXECUTED — deploy + first `commit(proofId, commitment)` INVOKED, owner-authorized; contract `CCKA2GYVILX7YZVSXGVIHOPNLTRBBF2SSWKBTQBIE7M67N5N2QMMXPSP`; tx `69044807410f65027c1227f4e525ad83f23a6cb1a2bb79790d82849c5dbc9fec`, ledger 65,337,373 | NOT_BUILT — the caller is CoreGuard's own script | `docs/evidence/stellar-soroban-commit-executed.json`; `node scripts/stellar-soroban-commit-executed.mjs --verify` |
| `stellar-dex-gate` — DEX-GATE/1 preflight | BUILT | REAL_BOOK_EXECUTED — five verdicts against the live XLM/USDC book; returns `PLAN_ONLY`, never sends | NOT_BUILT — no wallet or DApp embeds it | `docs/evidence/stellar-dex-gate-executed.json`; `node scripts/stellar-dex-gate-real.mjs --verify` |
| `stellar-agent-gate` — STELLAR-AGENT/1 policy matrix | BUILT | POLICY_GATE_EXECUTED — VERIFIED / REJECTED / HELD executed offline; `submit: NOT_PERFORMED` | NOT_BUILT — no agent deployment uses it | `docs/evidence/stellar-agent-gate-executed.json`; `node scripts/stellar-agent-gate-executed.mjs --verify` |
| `agent-gate` — AGENT-GATE/1 gate, receipts, independent verifier | BUILT | TEST_EXECUTED — 14-case walkthrough; receipt tamper and chain-break refusals | NOT_BUILT — prototype, no signer, no submission | `packages/agent-gate/index.mjs`; `test/integrations/agent-payment-gate.test.mjs` |
| `stellar-freighter` — Freighter wallet wrapper | BUILT_UNVERIFIED — no end-to-end test | NONE — credential-gated, never exercised | NOT_BUILT | `packages/stellar/freighter.mjs` |
| `stellar-mainnet-executor` — payment / invoke / anchor plans | PLAN_ONLY — returns `PLAN_OK` plus sample code | NONE | NOT_BUILT | `packages/stellar/mainnet-executor.mjs` |
| Signed funded DEX swap (owner wallet, 2026-11-06) | BUILT (runner script) | EXECUTED — `pathPaymentStrictSend` CONFIRMED, tx `ac2a7990b3387aab96b197c0c921d57756bd25d65ad0e75b93561ded640b9097`, ledger 65,338,112; 4.0598146 XLM to 0.6306239 USDC, wire read-back equals `fee_charged` to the stroop | NOT_BUILT — a one-off owner execution, not a product path | `docs/evidence/stellar-dex-swap-executed.json`; `node scripts/stellar-dex-swap-executed.mjs --verify` |
| Mainnet wallet and first payment | BUILT | EXECUTED — 0.1 XLM to SDF, ledger 65,308,317 | NOT_BUILT | `.stellar-tx-1.json` |

**One sentence for the Stellar block:** the *execution* record is real and
re-derivable; the *integration* record is empty. A judge can verify the former
today and cannot adopt the latter today.

## Pi Network

## Totals

Suite total: **1496 / 1496 pass**, machine-pinned in
`docs/state-snapshot.json` (the only authoritative count in the repo).
Boundary audit: **0 violations**; file count lives in the same snapshot.

| Integration status | Count |
|---|---|
| ADOPTED | **0** |
| PILOT | **0** |
| NOT_BUILT | **all surfaces** |

| Execution status | Count |
|---|---|
| EXECUTED (on-chain artifacts) | 6 |
| REAL_BOOK_EXECUTED / POLICY_GATE_EXECUTED | 3 |
| TEST_EXECUTED | 9 |
| NONE / not exercised | 5 |

**The sentence this matrix exists to make impossible:** "CoreGuard is a verified
Stellar integration." The supported sentences are: "CoreGuard has verifiable
execution evidence on Stellar mainnet" (true, checkable) and "CoreGuard has no
external Stellar adopter yet" (true, and it is the gap the roadmap closes).
