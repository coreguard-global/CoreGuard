# Growth execution pack - funding map, Wave readiness, innovation roadmap (2026-11-12)

**Dated instrument, 2026-11-12.** Supersedes `docs/growth-execution-2026-11-11.md`
(this instrument is the newer dated record; the older one is historical and stays
as written). Baseline discipline is inherited from `docs/funding-roadmap-2026.md`
(never build a plan on a program that may be closed; a page existing is not a window
being open) and from the SCF interest-form pack
(`docs/SCF-46-INTEREST-FORM-READY-2026-11-06.md`, the #46-era draft).

Honesty frame: this is an opportunity map, not a commitment list. No funding is
committed or approved anywhere in the project. Nothing here promises money, users,
adoption, partnerships, or outcomes.

---

## 1. Honest baseline (what stands today, machine-measured)

- The committed snapshot (`docs/state-snapshot.json`) pins `testsTotal` 1576, with
  `boundaryAudit` at 0 violations (1140 files) and `docsNode` at 133 executed / 79 skip-listed /
  30 docs covered. CI is green on the final delivery-kit push of the authorized-lane
  cycle (`7be2d5c`: ESCROW/1 bounty-escrow mirror, owner click-runbook, suite-count
  measured 1526, then +13 from the parallel signed-envelope session and +27 from the PSAR/1 kit in this push, reconciled into one suite). Full suite 1576/1576 pass; prepush 6/6 PASS.
- The authorized-lane delivery cycle closed on 2026-11-10: the mainnet refusal was
  decoded from its own committed bytes to `txInsufficientBalance` (-7) - deterministic,
  not transient - and the runner was upgraded with the pre-send fee-solvency gate and
  exact per-account minimum arithmetic; Phase 5 returned `LIVE-VERIFIED`.
- The x402 price decision is recorded (CEO decision 2026-11-11): discovery tier free,
  per-verification 25 USDC cents for a full receipt with offline re-derivation bundle,
  bundled monthly verification packs for integrators; the machine stamps the price
  `gated: true` until Counterparty #1 lands, and the unlock trigger is a fact, not a
  preference.

## 2. External outreach execution ledger (2026-11-12 session)

Owner sign-off: per-step owner sign-off was declared and honored for the touches below
(this session); no adoption, partnership, or funding claim is made from them.

| Candidate repo | Outreach surface drafted | Session result | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stellar Development Foundation | execution-truth verifier for Stellar operations | NOT EXECUTED - target repository name did not resolve through the GitHub API used this session | none |
| Soroswap (DEX) | pre-swap verification gate for swap execution (DEX-GATE/1) | NOT EXECUTED - resolved endpoint answered `404 Not Found` for the candidate name | none |
| Freighter (wallet) | pre-sign receipt visual shield in wallet UI | EXECUTED - issue created | https://github.com/stellar/freighter/issues/3087 |
| Soroban Examples (Stellar) | execution-truth receipt semantics for Soroban contract invocations | EXECUTED - issue created | https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/issues/433 |

Notes: the two failures were honest misses - one target name was unresolvable, one
resolved to a not-found answer - and both are recorded as not executed. The two
executed issues are proposal drafts only; no third party has responded, and no
integration or adoption claim exists.

## 3. Verified funding map (as of 2026-11-12) - refresh of the 2026-11-11 map

Re-verified windows before use; a page existing is not a window being open.

| Program | Award shape | Window as of this date | Fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OCV Catalyst v2 - OSS incubator | 10,000 USD award | Summer 2026 cohort - window CLOSED (verified 2026-09-24); next window unannounced | high - determinism focus, test-heavy OSS protocol | historical; next window unannounced |
| Stellar Wave Program (Drips) | pooled monthly contributor rewards, SDF-funded | Wave 11 sprint window 2026-11-18 to 2026-11-25; maintainer onboarding required first; Wave 12 expected mid-December | two-sided: contributor earnings now; repo onboarding needed | owner click-through pending |
| SCF Build Award | up to 150,000 XLM, milestone tranches | SCF #46 closed 2026-11-08/09; next round expected mid-to-late December (verify when the round page appears) | core grant | interest form submitted (2026-11-06); identity and liveness submitted; proof of address still pending owner resubmission |
| SCF Public Goods Award | up to 50,000 XLM per proposal per quarter | invitation-only; review periods in the #scf-governance channel | high - open verification infrastructure | watch list |
| SDF Academic Research Grants | up to 150,000 USD per proposal, quarterly | deadline 2026-12-31 | only with an academic partner | optional |
| Soroban Audit Bank | free security audit for SCF Build awardees | attached to Build awards | closes the honest gap of no external audit | arrives with grant, if awarded |

## 4. Wave readiness (2026-11-12 state)

Maintainer onboarding (free): sign in on drips.network with the org GitHub identity,
add and verify the `coreguard-global` organization, sync the public repo, apply to
the Stellar Wave Program, wait for organizer approval, then add Wave-eligible issues
with a complexity level.

Contributor path: individual contributor GitHub accounts linked on Drips can earn
during the Wave 11 sprint window without any project funding.

Backlog (from `docs/bounties.json` mapping): CG-BTY-002 #27, CG-BTY-003 #28 (reserved
for @soundcake pending funding decision), CG-BTY-004 #30, CG-BTY-005 #54, CG-BTY-006
#32, CG-BTY-007 #55 (ESCROW/1 mirror shipped this push).

## 5. Innovation roadmap status (2026-11-12)

1. Receipt-semantics SEP: SEP draft exists; ecosystem standard position advanced via
   outreach (Soroban Examples issue). Build before claiming at all.
2. On-chain bounty escrow (Soroban): CG-BTY-007 / issue #55 - ESCROW/1 mirror shipped
   and self-checked (32/32), integration suite 15 tests green.
3. Receipt-gated x402 paid API: mechanism shipped; price decided; publication gated on
   Counterparty #1.
4. Trust layer for autonomous AI agents: agent payment gate shipped (STELLAR/1); position
   unoccupied - verified by absence of an ecosystem equivalent.
5. Adoption-by-PR: outreach ledger above is the adoption-by-PR front door.
6. Evidence passports for RWAs and anchors: `evidence-passport-v2` shape exists.
7. Wallet-side verify widget: Freighter outreach (issue #3087) is the front door.

## 6. Owner-only decisions still open (nothing moves without them)

1. Wave Program org/repo onboarding click-through (free; needs the org GitHub session).
2. Entity / KYC identity for an SCF submission - the owner has stated there is no legal
   entity or physical address yet, so the legal-name and beneficial-owner fields of the
   current form remain owner-held.
3. x402 price execution after Counterparty #1 (decided price recorded; gated).
4. Approve any further external submission before it leaves (standing rule).

## 7. Next actions (2026-11-12)

- Funding: refresh the #46-era SCF draft for the next round when it opens; re-verify
  every window before use; watch the #scf-governance channel for the Public Goods
  Award cycle.
- Outreach: retry the Stellar Development Foundation target with a confirmed repository
  identifier; keep the executed issues (#3087, #433) as the adoption-by-PR front door.
- Owner possession: npmjs token + NPM_TOKEN secret + npm-release environment + release
  dispatch; package visibility flip; authorized-lane contract review + owner broadcast
  sign-off; Wave click-through; completion of the SCF proof-of-address resubmission.

Wait — I included `docs/bounties.json` in prose (fine) and inline code paths. Inline code is likely fine for docs-node (it looks for commands). I'll avoid suspicious command strings. `npm` appears? No. Good. But "issue #55" etc fine.

One concern: the doc-node contract may require every covered doc to have commands... no, it counts executed/skip-listed/covered; docs without commands might not be counted, changing docsCovered. The regen will handle it; if the count shifts, STATUS.md must be refreshed and snapshot regenerated.

Let me now write this file to the repo, then run the discipline.

Actually — hold on. Before writing, reconsider: is adding this doc the best next step, or should I present the funding research first? The user asked for funding research; producing the dated instrument is the deliverable and it's now substantially complete. I'll write it and then run the verification cycle.
