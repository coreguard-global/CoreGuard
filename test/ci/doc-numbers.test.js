/**
 * test/ci/doc-numbers.test.js
 *
 * THE single-source-of-truth bond for test-count claims across the repo's
 * reviewer-facing documents (owner mandate, 2026-11-07): every number a doc
 * states about the test suite must equal `docs/state-snapshot.json#testsTotal`
 * — the machine-measured total — and nothing may drift "because files were
 * updated asynchronously" (the exact defect this closes; the repo's first
 * live audit by an external reviewer flagged 1405/1436/1412/620 sitting side
 * by side without any rule).
 *
 * Scope EXCLUSIONS are deliberate and named, never a shrug:
 *   - docs/STATUS.md: row-bound by test/ci/status-truth.test.js (12 negative
 *     controls) — double-binding the same row from here would create TWO
 *     guards for one value with two failure vocabularies.
 *   - AGENTS.md: the operational-lessons chronicle; its numeric mentions are
 *     HISTORICAL lesson text (e.g. the "696/696" era in [C9]).
 *   - Dated instruments (allowlist below): docs that RECORD what a campaign/
 *     audit/packet/post measured at its own date. Their bodies are verbatim
 *     historical facts (some were already PUBLISHED — rewriting them would
 *     falsify the record), and they cannot be "current" by construction.
 *   - release/** and legacy-quarantine/**: hash-frozen trees never scanned.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - [C32] discipline: value-in-row binding is not possible for free prose,
 *     so the bond is: EVERY claim-shaped hit in a NON-allowlisted doc must
 *     equal testsTotal. A claim that a future doc writes with a deliberately
 *     different meaning (e.g. "73/73 adversarial benchmarks" — benchmarks,
 *     never tests) does NOT match the shapes, and adding a "tests"-worded
 *     subset claim must use the allowlist mechanism explicitly.
 *   - [C35] discipline: the scan enumerates the set itself — the guards below
 *     require a real, non-trivial hit count on the committed tree and at
 *     least one README hit, so a scanner that broke to ZERO hits can never
 *     masquerade as a green.
